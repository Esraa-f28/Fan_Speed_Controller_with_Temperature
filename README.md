# Fan Controller System

## Introduction

This mini-project introduces a temperature-controlled fan system employing the ATmega32 microcontroller, running at a frequency of 1MHz. The primary goal is to create an automated fan control system that responds to temperature fluctuations detected by the LM35 temperature sensor. Below are the key specifications and functionalities of the system:

## Specifications

### Objective
- Design a temperature-controlled fan system utilizing the ATmega32 microcontroller.

### Temperature Sensing
- Utilizes the LM35 temperature sensor, which continuously provides an analog output proportional to the temperature.
- The microcontroller converts the analog signal into digital values using the built-in ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter).

### Temperature Display
- Calculates the current temperature and displays it on an LCD screen.

### Fan Control
- The fan operation is determined by specific temperature thresholds:
   - If the temperature is below 30°C, the fan remains off.
   - At temperatures of 30°C or higher, the fan operates at 25% of its maximum speed.
   - For temperatures exceeding 60°C, the fan runs at 50% of its maximum speed.
   - If the temperature surpasses 90°C, the fan operates at 75% of its maximum speed.
   - At temperatures exceeding 120°C, the fan runs at 100% of its maximum speed.

### DC-Motor Control
- The fan state is controlled by turning the DC motor on or off.
- The DC motor rotates in a clockwise direction or stops, depending on the fan state.

### LCD Display
- The LCD continuously displays the current temperature and fan state.

### PWM Control
- The speed of the DC motor is controlled using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals generated by Timer0.

### Layered Architecture
- The project follows a layered architecture model, incorporating drivers for ADC, GPIO, LCD, Temperature Sensor, DC-Motor, and PWM.

- GPIO Driver
- ADC Driver
- PWM Driver (using Timer0)
- LM35 Temperature Sensor
- LCD Driver (8-bit data mode)
